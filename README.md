<strong>CubeSpin-3Dmodel</strong> - The version of spinning the cube that utilizes a 3D model of Marty's Cube. The model was converted into JSON and is using the JSONloader.js for three.js.

<strong>CubeSpin-CubeGeomerty</strong> - Ther version of spinning the cube that utilizes three.js's built in THREE.CubeGeometry function.


I've come to find that the renderers work as follows:

THREE.WebGLRenderer - Chrome, Firefox

THREE.CanvasRenderer - Chrome, Firefox, Safari(buggy)



<strong>Work that needs to be done:</strong>

Marty's Cube needs to spin from one of its corners.

Background needs to be fixed so cube is always in center on top of base.
